# Background
## Biological Inspiration

## Biological Neuron-Artificial Neuron

# Nerual Network

# Problems of Nerual Network
- Requires labeled data     
    » Most data is unlabeled
- Backpropagation solutions may be trapped in local minima
- Large networks (> 2 hidden layers) are harder to train 
    - Vanishing gradients
- Overfitting becomes a serious issue

# Until 2006 - Deep Learning
## Breakthrough work by GE Hinton’s group
- Proposed simple neural nets called Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), and stacked them to develop Deep Belief Networks (DBN’s)
- Came up with a fast algorithm for training them
- Demonstrated DBN beats state-of-the-art significantly
