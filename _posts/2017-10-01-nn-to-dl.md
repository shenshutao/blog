# Background
## Biological Inspiration

## Biological Neuron-Artificial Neuron

# Nerual Network

# Problems of Nerual Network
- Requires labeled data     
    Â» Most data is unlabeled
- Backpropagation solutions may be trapped in local minima
- Large networks (> 2 hidden layers) are harder to train 
    - Vanishing gradients
- Overfitting becomes a serious issue
